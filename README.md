### Paragraph: ###

This morning I saw this article on my twitter feed - Apple’s discussions with Nissan about the Apple Car had broken down over a dispute on branding. Over the last few years, Apple has made significant headway into creating a car manufacturing division, fueling the Apple Car rumours further. According to the article above, along with prior background information, Apple has approached many high-level, C-suite executives of other, successful car companies in an effort to assist the trillion-dollar company with its Apple Car division. According to some rumors, along with Hyundai issuing a statement themselves, they have already signed an agreement with the Korean car company with an Apple Car expected mid-2025.  

This is an interesting conversation because Apple has already released the Apple Car software which has been wildly successful in integrating the phone’s capabilities with the car. The premium they charge for this software enables them to capture a revenue stream, without worrying about the manufacturing difficulties that arise in manufacturing a car. However, building the car themselves, while increase bottomline quantitatively, may not be the best approach for the company, qualitatively. On the other hand, we have seen the Apple Effect (as I like to call it) many times, including with the wireless headphones industry as well as with the wearable tech/smartwatch industry. 

Who knows? If the Apple Car does come to fruition, I believe it’ll either bomb spectacularly or we might finally have a true Tesla competitor on our hands. Either way, I am excited to see what the future holds! 

### Additional Comments - Larry Langman ###

It is interesting how Apple is focusing on its core strength, software, and outsourcing the physical car manufacturing that it cannot compete with. Of course, this is a logical move as it allows Apple to devote its full resources to developing this new technology rather than trying to compete with automotive giants. Still, the fact that talks have broken down is unfortunate. This difficulty in negotiation could be attributed to the whole automotive industry, which is highly competitive yet closed off from new entrants. In terms of software, the news in this article suggests that outsourcing may still be difficult in today's globalized economy, with both Nissan and Hyundai having claimed not to be working with Apple. While it is unclear what caused Apple's talks with the firms to end, the prospect of other relationships with car manufacturers still exists. Then again, perhaps Apple will attempt to directly compete in the car industry and set up its own automotive manufacturing facilities. This story is certainly a noteworthy one to follow and has a great overlap of the intersection of business and software.
